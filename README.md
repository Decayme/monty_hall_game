My attempt to make a game about the paradox

This is a work in progress:

So far:

Dooors opened and closed have been imported,
They open and close when clicked,
I tested the game logic in code not in pygame with text and it works,
I made a simple ui that worked for a bit,
I combined everything together and its not working currently.
